# McGill University - COMP202
## Office Hours by Appointment
After a semester of online learning, the teaching staff of COMP202 at McGill University needed a way to hold office hours by appointment to ensure students could get help from the instructors without waiting for hours in Zoom waiting rooms. 

During the Christmas break of 2020, I worked on this project to address this issue.
